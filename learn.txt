--- CELERY ----
 $ celery -A app.celery worker --loglevel INFO --logfile logs.log

-- FLOWER --
 $ celery -A app.celery flower --port=5555 --broker=redis://localhost:6379/0 => where app is the file and celery is the celery instance
   The official flower docker image does not have a tag for versions greater than 0.9.7 thus why this version was used.
   to see the version that yuu are using, use the command
   $ docker compose exec flower pip freeze


--- Authentication ----- (lets add basic authentication)
sudo apt install apache2-utils => To install htpasswd
htpasswd -c htpasswd antony

htpasswd => This is the command-line utility used to manage user files for basic authentication in an Apache HTTP server.
-c => this specifies that a new file should be created. If it exists, it is overwritten(deletes everything). if this flag is ommited, the new user will be added to the existing file
htpasswd => This is the password file to be created or updated.
antony => this is the username 

once the file is created, now mount it to the nginx service


------ execution -----
$ docker compose up -d --build
$ docker compose exec worker python 
   from app import add
   task = add.delay(10, 20)
   task.status
   task.result 
navigate to http://localhost:5555 => you will be prompted to enter your username and password.(admin, pass)
